The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) plays a pivotal role in shaping educational policies and practices around the globe. In the age of rapid technological advancement, UNESCO has turned its attention to the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance educational outcomes and address longstanding challenges in the sector.

### UNESCO and AI: Empowering Education

UNESCO recognizes the transformative power of AI in education. It sees AI as a tool not only for improving learning outcomes but also for making education more accessible and equitable. AI technologies offer the promise of personalized learning experiences tailored to the needs and pace of each student, thereby overcoming the one-size-fits-all approach that has long dominated traditional educational systems.

Furthermore, UNESCO highlights the importance of AI in supporting educators, enhancing learner engagement, and facilitating the management and delivery of education. The organization emphasizes the need for ethical considerations and policies to ensure that AI technologies are used responsibly and for the benefit of all students, without exacerbating existing inequalities.
